Netmin is a project of Nettech Private Limited.

At Nettech we are planning to come up with a shell based tool to do all the Server Administration, which we can give it to our future students along with webmin. Interested students are requested to download the .tar/.gz file & start working on the same. Nettech will acknowledge all contribution with a Certificate of Excellence & Credit on this page. 

Important notes :

1. download the .tar/.gz file, copy the same in server "/" location

2. use the command "gzip -d netmin.tar.gz" to get a .tar file

3. use the command "tar xvf netmin.tar" to extract the files from the .tar file

4. make sure you have 755 in all the files, run ./netmin file to start the program

5. open with vi or any other editor to do the necessary addition & modification

6. for any clarification & submission email it to swapan[at]nettech.in with a note of your work.

 
 
This is the Starting of this project. This file will be modified accordingly.
