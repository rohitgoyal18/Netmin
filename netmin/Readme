Sir this is a Starting script I have prepared for the Project NETMIN
This only contains the menu and submenus 
It also contains a script for change password unser system Menu.
I would like to get suggestions from you for the development of this project.
I would like to know if some new menu or options to be added into it.

I am trying it to make like Webmin.
Trying to give the same functionality and options in Netmin also 


Change Passwords
Since there are different no of users in different Unix System, so it is not possible to create a static script to work in all systems.
So this function creates its own temporary script based on the system and add all the users and gives the option to change password.(somewhat like Webmin)

If any other way is possible then please suggest.
